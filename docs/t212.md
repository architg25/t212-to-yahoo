# Trading 212 Public API

Welcome to the official API reference for the Trading 212 Public API! This guide provides all the information you need to start building your own trading applications and integrations.

---

# General Information

This API is currently in **beta** and is under active development. We're continuously adding new features and improvements, and we welcome your feedback.

### API Environments

We provide two distinct environments for development and trading:

* **Paper Trading (Demo):** `https://demo.trading212.com/api/v0`
* **Live Trading (Real Money):** `https://live.trading212.com/api/v0`

You can test your applications extensively in the paper trading environment without risking real funds before moving to live trading.

### ⚠️ API Limitations

Please be aware of the following limitations for any order placement:

* **Supported account types:**  The Trading 212 Public API is enabled and usable only for **Invest and Stocks ISA** account types.
* **Live trading order types:** For the live (real money) environment, only **Market Orders** are supported for execution via the API.
* **Order execution:** Orders can be executed only in the **primary account currency**
* **Multi-currency:** Multi-currency accounts are not currently supported through the API. Meaning your account, position and result values in the responses will be in the primary account currency.

### Key Concepts

* **Authentication:** Every request to the API must be authenticated using a secure key pair. See the **Authentication** section below for details.
* **Rate Limiting:** All API calls are subject to rate limits to ensure fair usage and stability. See the **Rate Limiting** section for a full explanation.
* **IP Restrictions:** For enhanced security, you can optionally restrict your API keys to a specific set of IP addresses from within your Trading 212 account settings.
* **Selling Orders:** To execute a sell order, you must provide a **negative** value for the `quantity` parameter (e.g., `-10.5`). This is a core convention of the API.

## Quickstart

This simple example shows you how to retrieve your account's cash balance.

First, you must generate your API keys from within the Trading 212 app. For detailed instructions, please visit our Help Centre:

* [**How to get your Trading 212 API key**](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/14584770928157-Trading-212-API-key)

Once you have your **API Key** and **API Secret**, you can make your first call using `cURL`:

```bash
# Step 1: Replace with your actual credentials and Base64-encode them.
# The `-n` is important as it prevents adding a newline character.
CREDENTIALS=$(echo -n "<YOUR_API_KEY>:<YOUR_API_SECRET>" | base64)

# Step 2: Make the API call to the live environment using the encoded credentials.
curl -X GET "https://live.trading212.com/api/v0/equity/account/cash" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic $CREDENTIALS"
```

---

# Authentication

The API uses a secure key pair for authentication on every request. You must provide your **API Key** as the username and your **API Secret** as the password, formatted as an HTTP Basic Authentication header.

The `Authorization` header is constructed by Base64-encoding your `API_KEY:API_SECRET` string and prepending it with `Basic `.

### Building the Authorization Header

Here are examples of how to generate the required value in different environments.

**Linux or macOS (Terminal)**

You can use the `echo` and `base64` commands. Remember to use the `-n` flag with `echo` to prevent it from adding a trailing newline, which would invalidate the credential string.

```bash
# This command outputs the required Base64-encoded string for your header.
echo -n "<YOUR_API_KEY>:<YOUR_API_SECRET>" | base64
```

**Python**

This simple snippet shows how to generate the full header value.

```python
import base64

# 1. Your credentials
api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
api_secret = "<YOUR_API_SECRET>"

# 2. Combine them into a single string
credentials_string = f"{api_key}:{api_secret}"

# 3. Encode the string to bytes, then Base64 encode it
encoded_credentials = base64.b64encode(credentials_string.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')

# 4. The final header value
auth_header = f"Basic {encoded_credentials}"

print(auth_header)
```

# Rate Limiting

To ensure high performance and fair access for all users, all API endpoints are subject to rate limiting.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** All rate limits are applied on a per-account basis, regardless of which API key is used or which IP address the request originates from.

Specific rate limits are detailed in the reference for each endpoint.

### Response Headers

Every API response includes the following headers to help you manage your request frequency and avoid hitting limits.

* `x-ratelimit-limit`: The total number of requests allowed in the current time period.
* `x-ratelimit-period`: The duration of the time period in seconds.
* `x-ratelimit-remaining`: The number of requests you have left in the current period.
* `x-ratelimit-reset`: A Unix timestamp indicating the exact time when the limit will be fully reset.
* `x-ratelimit-used`: The number of requests you have already made in the current period.

### How It Works

The rate limiter allows for requests to be made in bursts. For example, an endpoint with a limit of `50 requests per 1 minute` does **not** strictly mean you can only make one request every 1.2 seconds. Instead, you could:

* Make a burst of all 50 requests in the first 5 seconds of a minute. You would then need to wait for the reset time indicated by the `x-ratelimit-reset` header before making more requests.
* Pace your requests evenly, for example, by making one call every 1.2 seconds, ensuring you always stay within the limit.

### Function-Specific Limits

In addition to the general rate limits on HTTP calls, some actions have their own functional limits. For example, there is a maximum of **50 pending orders** allowed per ticker, per account.

Order Limitations
* Orders can be executed only in the main account currency
* Only Market Orders are supported for the live (real money) environment

Important: In this beta version, this endpoint is not idempotent. Sending the same request multiple times may result in duplicate orders.

### Place a Stop Order

- [POST /api/v0/equity/orders/stop](https://docs.trading212.com/api/equity-orders/placestoporder_1.md): Rate Limit: 1 request per 2 seconds

Creates a new Stop order, which places a Market order once the stopPrice is reached.
- To place a buy stop order, use a positive quantity.
- To place a sell stop order (commonly a 'stop-loss'), use a negative quantity.

- The stopPrice is triggered by the instrument's Last Traded Price (LTP).



Order Limitations
* Orders can be executed only in the main account currency
* Only Market Orders are supported for the live (real money) environment


Important: In this beta version, this endpoint is not idempotent. Sending the same request multiple times may result in duplicate orders.

### Place a Stop-Limit Order

- [POST /api/v0/equity/orders/stop_limit](https://docs.trading212.com/api/equity-orders/placestoporder.md): Rate Limit: 1 request per 2 seconds

Creates a new Stop-Limit order, combining features of a Stop and a Limit order. The direction of the trade (buy/sell) is determined by the sign of the quantity field.

Execution Logic:
1.  When the instrument's Last Traded Price (LTP) reaches the specified stopPrice, the order is triggered.
2.  A Limit order is then automatically placed at the specified limitPrice.

This two-step process helps protect against price slippage that can occur with a standard Stop order.
